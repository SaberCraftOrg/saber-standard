# CLAUDE.md — Saber Standard Repository

This repository is the canonical source for the **Saber Standard**, a choreographed saber combat notation framework. It is published as an MkDocs Material site at https://standard.sabercraft.org. All documentation lives in `docs/`.

## Naming rules (strict — do not violate)

These terms were settled by formal architecture decisions. Never rename, "correct," or swap them:

- **Saber Standard** — the framework itself. Formerly called "LUMINA Standard" and then "SaberCraft Standard"; both renames are complete. Never reintroduce either older name. The framework name deliberately drops "Craft" so the standard reads as independent of any single school.
- **Saber Standard Notation** — the written movement language of the Saber Standard. Formerly the "Temporal Notation System", the "LUMINA Notation System", and then "SaberCraft Notation"; all renames are complete. The naming-history note on `notation/index.md` lists the superseded names on purpose — that is the one place they may still appear.
- **LUMINA Games** — the optional game/scoring layer (Duels and Duets), documented under `docs/games/`. This keeps the LUMINA name permanently. Do not rename it to "SaberCraft Games."
- **Lumina Federation LLC** — the legal entity. Never alter, rebrand, or expand this name.
- **Saberist** — the general term for any practitioner of the Saber Standard. Use this everywhere a practitioner is referenced.
- **Lumen / Lumens** — refers ONLY to players within LUMINA Games. Never use it as a general practitioner term. In particular, CM lesson pages label the two roles **Saberist A** and **Saberist B** — never "Lumen 1"/"Lumen 2", even for a dual-wielding movement. A CM page may still link to LUMINA Games where it discusses the game layer, such as a telegraph.
- **CM** — short for **Choreography Movement**. Movements are identified by CM codes (CM-A, CM-B, ...). The overview page at `docs/core/index.md` uses the public-facing heading "Choreography Movements (CM)", and the nav group is labelled "Choreographies". New students are directed to CM-A through CM-E first; the full catalog lives in the repo at `docs/core/cm-catalog.md`. It was previously hosted at https://sabercraft.org/cm-series-catalog/ — that link has been retired from the docs, so do not reintroduce it.
- **SaberCraft** (alone) — the founding school and community at https://sabercraft.org. When contrasting the framework with the school, write "the Saber Standard" for the framework, never bare "SaberCraft." Pages such as `faq.md`, `for-schools.md`, and `standard.md` deliberately contrast the two — do not "deduplicate" them.

## Technical exceptions

- CSS class names such as `lumina-hero`, `lumina-button`, and variables like `--lumina-red` are defined in `docs/assets/stylesheets/sabercraft.css` and are intentionally unchanged. Never rename them in markdown or CSS — doing so silently breaks homepage styling. A theme-wide class rename is a separate, deliberate future task tracked in Notion.
- `docs/CNAME` must contain exactly `standard.sabercraft.org`. Never change it as part of any other edit.

## Site and URL conventions

- Public site: https://standard.sabercraft.org (GitHub Pages, DNS via QUIC.cloud CNAME `standard` → `luminafederation.github.io`).
- https://sabercraft.org is the school/community site (WordPress) — a different property. Do not point framework doc links at it except where a page intentionally references the school. Pages that document the school itself — `classes.md`, `what-saber-to-buy.md`, `is-this-class-for-me.md` — live in this repo rather than linking out to their WordPress originals.
- The stale domain `lumina.sabercraft.org` is reserved for LUMINA Games. Do not use it in framework documentation.
- Diagrams for targets, attacks, and parries live in the repo as committed images, and every diagram block is wrapped in `<div class="diagram-table" markdown>`. Three distinct layouts are in use — preserve whichever one a page already uses:
    - **Target overview trio** (`targets-overview-1/2/3.webp`) — a single three-across row of `{ width="200" }` thumbnails, each wrapped in a `.diagram-zoom` link to the full-size image, with bold inline captions and a closing "Select any diagram to open it full size in a new tab." line. The same block appears on `notation/index.md` and `notation/targets.md`; keep the two identical. These were previously full-width `<figure>` elements and are deliberately no longer laid out that way.
    - **Attack and parry diagram grids** (`notation/attacks.md`, `notation/parries.md`) — 2×3 markdown tables of `{ width="200" }` thumbnails with bold inline captions and no zoom links.
    - **Reference tables on `notation/index.md`** — thumbnails embedded in a data table alongside notation and descriptions. Both the Attacking and Defending tables pair opposite lines two per row at `{ width="140" }`, and both carry the extra `target-pairs` class on the wrapper. That class enlarges the notation in the first and fourth columns and draws the vertical rule that separates the two halves of the row (see `docs/assets/stylesheets/sabercraft.css`); the narrower thumbnail is what lets six columns fit, so do not raise it back to 200 without also dropping back to one pair per row.

## Writing rules

- All pages under `docs/` are **student-facing**. No internal planning notes, steward commentary, TODO language, or "we will eventually" phrasing in published pages.
- Tone: clear, welcoming, instructional. Assume the reader is a new Saberist unless the page states otherwise.
- Do not invent mechanics, CM codes, terminology, or rules. If documentation is ambiguous or missing, stop and ask in the issue/PR rather than filling gaps.
- Licensing: public materials are **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** — attribution, non-commercial, share-alike — as stated on `licensing.md`. Commercial use is not granted and requires a separate written license from Lumina Federation LLC; `licensing.md` ends with Permission Requests as the route for that. Do not restate licensing terms on other pages; link to `licensing.md`.
- **Copyright, not trademark, is the guardrail. Lumina Federation LLC holds no trademark.** Never call SaberCraft, the Saber Standard, Saber Standard Notation, LUMINA, or Lumina Federation a trademark, and never add ™/® or a trademark notice to them. This does not affect third-party marks: the "Names and trademarks" disclaimer on `core/extended-library.md` correctly notes that film and character names belong to their owners, and should stay.

## Governance

- Newest approved documentation wins. Decisions are recorded in the project's Notion workspace; historical pages are bannered as superseded, not rewritten.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits. When a change touches naming, licensing, or structure, describe the rationale in the PR body.
